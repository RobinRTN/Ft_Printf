# Ft_Printf

## Overview
The ft_printf project is my implementation of the C standard library function printf. This exercise was part of my curriculum at Ecole 42, focusing exclusively on the mandatory features, without the bonus part. The project was a significant learning experience in managing formatted output in C.

## Key Features
The recreated printf function in this project supports:
Format Specifiers
Handles basic format specifiers like %c, %s, %p, %d, and %x.
Width and Precision
Manages field width and precision for more refined output control.
Variadic Arguments
Uses the stdarg.h library to handle a variable number of arguments, enhancing the function's flexibility.

## Challenges
String Parsing: Developing a parser for interpreting format strings was a major focus.
Type Conversion: Converting different data types into properly formatted strings.
